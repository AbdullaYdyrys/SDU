In our spare time, during breaks at the university, we spend a lot of time to find a free office. 
The purpose of my work was to create a user-friendly and easy-to-use application that will help 
solve this problem and facilitate the search for a free office. SDU ROOMS is an application   
written in the Java language that creates a comfortable life for people, has a modern, intuitive 
interface and very easy to use. The application is convenient for students and for teachers. 
If teachers want to spend extra lesson with students they will not have to look for and spend an 
effort on it.
